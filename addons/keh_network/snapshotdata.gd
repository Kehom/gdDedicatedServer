# This function is meant to be run on clients but not called remotely. The objective here
# is to take the provided snapshot, which contains server's data, locate the internal
# corresponding snapshot and compare them. Any differences are to be considered as errors
# in the client's prediction and must be corrected using the server's data.
# Corresponding snapshot means, primarily, the snapshot with the same input signatures.
# However, it's possible the server will send snapshot without any client's input. This will
# always be the case at the very beginning of the client's session, when there is no
# server data to initiate the local simulation. Still, if there is enough data loss
# during the synchronization then the sever will have to send snapshot data without any
# client's input.
# That said, the overall tasks here:
# - Snapshot contains input -> locate the snapshot in the history with the same input
#   signature and use that one to compare, removing any older (or equal) from the history.
# - Snapshot does not contain input -> take the last snapshot in the history to use for
#   comparison and don't remove anything from the history.
# During the comparison, any difference must be corrected by applying the server state into
# all snapshots in the local history.
# On errors the ideal path is to locally re-simulate the game using cached input data
# just so no input is missed on small errors. Since this is not possible with Godot then
# just apply the corrected state into the corresponding nodes and hope the interpolation
