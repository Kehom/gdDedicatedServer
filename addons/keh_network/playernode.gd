# The input cache is used in two different ways, depending on which machine
# it's running and which player this node corresponds to.
# Running on server:
# - If this node corresponds to the local player (the server), then the
#   cache does nothing because there is no need to validate its data.
# - If this node corresponds to a client then the cache will hold the
#   received input data, which will be retrieved from it when iterating
#   the game state. At that moment the input is removed from the buffer
#   and a secondary container holds information that maps from the
#   snapshot signature to the used input signature. With this information
#   when encoding snapshot data it's possible to attach to it the
#   signature of the input data used to simulate the game. Another thing
#   to keep in mind is that incoming input data may be out of order or
#   duplicated. To that end it's a lot simpler to deal with a dictionary
#   to hold the objects.
# Running on client:
# - If this node corresponds to a remote player, does nothing because a
#   client knows nothing about other clients nor the server in regards
#   to input data.
# - If this node corresponds to the local player then the cache must
#   hold a sequential (ascending) set of input objects that are mostly
#   meant for validation when snapshot data arrives. When validating,
#   any input older than the one just checked must be removed from the
#   container, thus keeping this data in ascending order makes things
#   a lot easier. In this case it's better to have an array rather than
#   dictionary to hold this data.
# With all this information in mind, this inner class is meant to make
# things a bit easier to deal with those differences.
