# Meant to make things easier to manage player data by holding containers
# and providing access function to manipulate those.
# This is not meant to be manually instanced but direct access to an object
# of this class is very helpful specially when player list is required. To
# that end, it should be pretty simple to do so using the instance that is
# automatically created within the network singleton (network.player_data).
