# TODO:
# - Method to "cull" objects from snapshots which may lead to *some* bandwidth
#   savings. One such case would be to eliminate every object that is relatively
#   far from the client and maybe even impossible to be seen.
# - Some way to get raw snapshot data so it can be used in a save game system.
#   Obviously a function must be provided to allow restoring from this data.
# - If possible, separate data exchange into network channels. In this case, create
#   channels for: snapshot, chat, input and ping/pong data
# - Better communicate (with warning or something) whenever there are non replicable
#   properties defined within SnapEntityBase derived classes
# - A function to "whisper" a message to the specified player in a way that the
#   message goes through the server first. This can be useful for logging purposes


# Limitations:
# - The integrated input system makes it almost impossible to mix local
#   multiplayer with networked multiplayer in a single game instance
# - The integrated input system encodes boolean actions into a single integer of
#   either 8, 16 or 32 bits, meaning that "only" 32 boolean actions can be used
#   with this system.
# - The various signatures (input, snapshot...) are using 32 bit integers
#   meaning that if the game is set to 60 frames per second then after
#   slightly more than 4 years and a half of continuously running, the
#   the game will break, forcing a restart to occur periodically.
# - The replicated event system packs the event code (ID) using 16 bits, meaning
#   that only 65536 different event types can be used with this sytem.


# When trying to create a server the result is not instant. Because of that,
# signals are required. The next two are for success of failure, respectively.
signal server_created
signal server_creation_failed

# Whenever a new player is added into the internal list (registered) or removed
# (unregistered) a signal will be emitted, with the ID of that player.
signal player_added(id)
signal player_removed(id)

# If the credential system is being used this signal will be emitted only on
# client machines trying to join the server, indicating that the server is
# requesting the credential data.
signal credentials_requested

# Joining a server can fail, be accepted or rejected. The following signals
# indicate those, respectively. In the rejection case, an string is given
# with the rejection reason.
signal join_fail
signal join_accepted
signal join_rejected(reason)

# A client will get this signal whenever disconnected from the server
signal disconnected

# This will be given whenever the measured ping value of a player is changed.
# The arguments are the peer id and the measured value, respectively.
signal ping_updated(peer, value)

# A client gets this signal when kicked from the server, with the reason as argument.
signal kicked(reason)

# This signal is emitted whenever a chat message is received. The first argument is
