## Godot Dedicated Server Tutorial

The code on this repository is reference material to a written tutorial found on my web page, [www.kehomsforge.com][http://www.kehomsforge.com/tutorials/single/gdDedicatedServer].

Note that this project uses my networking addon (which is included within this repository). This addon itself is part of a pack, which can be found on [this repository](https://github.com/Kehom/GodotAddonPack).
