## Godot Dedicated Server Tutorial

The code on this repository is reference material to a written tutorial found on my web page, [www.kehomsforge.com](http://www.kehomsforge.com/tutorials/single/gdDedicatedServer).

Note that this project uses my networking addon (which is included within this repository). This addon itself is part of a pack, which can be found on [this repository](https://github.com/Kehom/GodotAddonPack).

Update (Nov 19, 2020): There is now a new (and better) method of not instantiating unnecessary nodes within the dedicated server route. The tutorial has been updated with the new code. The old method is still available in a different branch (target-gd3.2_old).
